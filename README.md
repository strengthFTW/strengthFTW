Hey there! 👋

I’m Ritesh, a computer science student specializing in AI & ML, based in Hyderabad, India.

I design and build practical projects across web, AI, and data.

If an idea clicks, I usually turn it into a working project and push it to GitHub.

My main tech stack is Python, JavaScript, React / Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.
My favorite tools are VS Code, GitHub, and Figma.

I’ve worked on multiple frontend, AI, and academic projects, with a focus on clean UI and real-world logic.

One of my favorite projects is Calisthenix, a gamified fitness web app.

I actively build and experiment with new ideas while improving my DSA and problem-solving skills.

If you want to explore my work, my portfolio and repositories are available here.

Fun Facts:

• I enjoy anime and going to the gym
• I like building things more than just learning theory
• I prefer learning by doing
